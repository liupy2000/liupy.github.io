# ðŸ”¥ About
I am a Ph.D. candidate in the Department of Industrial Engineering, Tsinghua University. I received my B.Eng. in this department, too. I visited Durham University Business School in the UK from 1/2024 to 8/2024. My current research involves consumer choice modeling, data-driven supply chain management, and operations research in energy interface. This line of research has been recognized with the finalist of 2018 INFORMS Franz Edelman Award, and 2018 POMS Emerging Economies Doctoral Students Award.

My research interest includes neural machine translation and computer vision. I have published more than 100 papers at the top international AI conferences with total <a href='https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=DhtAFkwAAAAJ'>google scholar citations <strong><span id='total_cit'>260000+</span></strong></a> (You can also use google scholar badge <a href='https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=DhtAFkwAAAAJ'><img src="https://img.shields.io/endpoint?url={{ url | url_encode }}&logo=Google%20Scholar&labelColor=f6f6f6&color=9cf&style=flat&label=citations"></a>).
